Application Deployment on Streamlit via Render
Step 1: Set Up GitHub Repository

Add all the required files, including the Streamlit app script (singapore.py), model files, and data files to your GitHub repository.

Step 2: Create requirements.txt

Create a requirements.txt file in your GitHub repository and list all the necessary packages required to run the Streamlit app. This helps Render understand the dependencies.

Example requirements.txt:

Navigate to "Web Services" and select "Connect to GitHub."
Follow the setup process, connecting your GitHub repository to Render.
Set up the web service with the run command: streamlit run singapore.py.
Step 4: User Interaction and Prediction

Once the web service is set up, users can interact with the Streamlit app to predict resale flat prices.

Select Conditions:

Users can choose conditions such as town, flat type, floor area, and more using the user interface.
